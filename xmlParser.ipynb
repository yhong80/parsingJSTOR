He revealed that his interest had been piqued by the American hippie movement after watching a documentary about Woodstock in a movie theater in Hong Kong. His comments are particularly illuminating not only because they highlight his extensive intellectual journey, but also his liberal mindset.

He thus never maintained that by reconstructing Confucian traditions it was possible to find a cure-all for the downsides of modernity. In most cases, culturalist juxtapositions rely on a static conceptualization of (Western) modernity that rests on makeshift analyses from the social sciences. Furthermore, there is often a strong normativist tendency to hypostasize the value orientations of individuals and groups who are</p>\n",

The continuation of traditions was no longer a matter of quasi-natural perpetuation, but based on efforts of renewal, rediscovery, re-appropriation, re-implementation and, most of all, discursive justification. As a private individual, Tang reacted to the exilic threat of a loss of traditional life forms by paying serious attention, apparently for the first time in his life, to the religious-ritual importance of holidays and festivities.
